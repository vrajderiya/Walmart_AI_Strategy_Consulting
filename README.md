# Walmart AI Strategy Consulting Project

**Project Manager, Graduate Consulting Team | University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**  
*AI Transformation Roadmap for Walmart Customer Experience*

Led a 5-member graduate consulting team under Associate Professor Yoo-Seong Song to develop an AI strategy addressing Walmart's customer experience challenges like stockouts, checkout delays, and personalization gaps. Directed project scoping, research coordination, and deliverable production—including user analysis, competitive benchmarking against Amazon/Costco, and a comprehensive 4-pillar AI roadmap: unified predictive data core, autonomous operations, predictive personalized customer experience (dynamic loyalty/household personalization), and agentic commerce ecosystem. 

Walmart generated **$648B revenue** in FY2024 with **15.9% e-commerce penetration**, yet faces **CSAT ~70** (vs. Costco/Target ~80) due to empty shelves, long checkouts, fragmented personalization, and reactive operations blocking AI tools like Sparky. **Central Question**: How can Walmart leverage AI to enhance CX and maintain U.S. competitiveness?

## 4-Pillar AI Roadmap
| Pillar | Core Focus | Key Technologies | Projected Impact |
|--------|------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Unified Predictive Data Core** | Real-time identity/inventory fusion | Identity graph + Luminate, event pipelines | Single source of truth across CX/operations |
| **Autonomous Retail Operations** | Execution reliability | Computer vision (99.5% accuracy), Symbotic robotics, digital twins | 30% stockout reduction, 50% labor reallocation |
| **Predictive Personalized CX** | Dynamic loyalty/household personalization | Real-time rewards engine, household graphs, mission detection | 20-30% loyalty engagement uplift |
| **Agentic Commerce Ecosystem** | End-to-end automation | AI shopping agents, multi-channel orchestration | CSAT uplift, seamless omnichannel journeys |

**24-Month Implementation**: Metrics include CSAT uplift, inventory accuracy, fulfillment speed, personalization engagement, AI ROI.

## My Leadership Contributions
- **Project Management**: Directed scoping, weekly client updates, milestone reviews, executive presentations
- **Research Coordination**: Oversaw user analysis (3 personas: suburban mom, urban millennial, rural shopper), competitive benchmarking
- **Strategy Development**: Architected 4-pillar framework, issue trees, implementation roadmap with success metrics
- **Team Leadership**: Managed 5-member MS Information Management team under tight semester timeline

**Skills Demonstrated**: Strategic Consulting | AI Strategy | Project Management | Team Leadership | Market Research | Competitive Analysis | User Personas | Executive Presentations | Issue Trees | SWOT Analysis | Porter's Five Forces | Roadmap Development

**Key Insights**: Walmart's scale creates unmatched AI inputs, but siloed data/legacy systems block customer-facing impact. Manual inventory checks (85% accuracy) cause 80% of stockouts—computer vision solves this fundamentally. Household graphs + real-time rewards can capture 20-30% wallet growth.
